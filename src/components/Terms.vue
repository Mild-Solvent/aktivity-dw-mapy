          <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The materials on TrackFinder are provided on an 'as is' basis. TrackFinder makes no warranties, expressed or implied, 
            and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions

          <h2>5. Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            In no event shall TrackFinder or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, 
            damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use 
            the materials on TrackFinder, even if TrackFinder or an authorized representative has been notified orally or 
            in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied 
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

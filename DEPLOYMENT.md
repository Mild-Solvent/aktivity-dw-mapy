# Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

## ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your dynamic track system is now ready for GitHub Pages! Here's what's been set up:

### 🎯 **Features Complete**
- ✅ Dynamic track loading from individual folders
- ✅ Each track has its own JSON config with all display data
- ✅ Tracks automatically appear when added to `assets/tracks/`
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ All original functionality preserved
- ✅ Build tested and working

### 📁 **Current Track Structure**
```
assets/tracks/
├── vrsatec/
│   ├── track-info.json ✅
│   ├── preview.png     ✅
│   └── track.gpx       ✅
├── mountain-biking-trail/
├── river-run/
├── forest-hike/
└── README.md (detailed instructions)
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 2. Adding New Tracks (Simple 3-step process)
```bash
# 1. Create folder and add files
mkdir assets/tracks/my-new-track
# Add: track-info.json, preview.png, track.gpx

# 2. Update the system
npm run tracks:scan

# 3. Deploy
npm run deploy
```

## 📋 **Track Configuration**

Each track's `track-info.json` contains:
- **📏 Distance, ⏱️ Duration, ⛰️ Elevation, 📍 Start Point**
- **Custom stats with icons and labels**
- **About section with creation date and experience text**
- **All display information that appears when clicking tracks**

Example format:
```json
{
  "id": "my-track",
  "name": "My Track Name",
  "description": "Track description...",
  "stats": {
    "distance": {
      "icon": "📏",
      "label": "Vzdialenosť", 
      "value": "15.2 km"
    }
    // ... more stats
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "O tejto trase",
    "createdText": "Vytvorené dňa November 3, 2024",
    "experienceText": "Táto trasa ponúka zážitok..."
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **For Development**

### Testing locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Updating tracks:
```bash
npm run tracks:scan
```

## 📝 **Notes**

- ✅ **Static hosting compatible** - no server-side dependencies
- ✅ **GitHub Pages optimized** - uses static file loading
- ✅ **Scalable** - easily add unlimited tracks
- ✅ **Maintainable** - each track is self-contained
- ✅ **Dynamic** - tracks auto-appear when added

## 🎉 **Result**

When you add new tracks to the `assets/tracks/` folder, they automatically appear on the main page with all the dynamic information you specified:
- Distance, Duration, Elevation, Start Point with icons
- Custom about section and creation date
- All data dynamically rendered from the JSON files

**Your site is ready for GitHub Pages deployment!** 🚀
